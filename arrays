 An array can be best defined as a collection of similar data items.In this all the elements share the common name.Each element of the
 array can be accessed by the subscript(or index).Array is used to process,store and print large amount of similar data using a single 
 variable.
 Example 1:Set of integers,set of characters are the examples of arrays
 Example 2:Grade of all the students in a class is a character array.
 The pictorial representation of an array of 5 integers can be shown as:
 
                              A[0]=10
                              A[1]=12
                              A[2]=30
                              A[3]=50
                              A[4]=35
 
 CLASSIFICATION OF ARRAYS:
 Arrays can be mainly classified into 2 types:
 1]. SINGLE DIMENSIONAL ARRAY
 2]. MULTI DIMENSIONAL ARRAY
 Single-Dimensional arrays:
 It can be defined as a linear list consisting of related data items of same type.In this all the data items are stored in contiguous
 memory location one after the another.For example,a single dimensional array consisting of of 5 integer elements can be shown as follows.
                                                
                                                10    20   30   40   50   
                                                A[0] A[1] A[2] A[3] A[4]

An index or subscript gives the position of an element in the array.For eg,in the above array:

* 0th item 10 can be accessed by specifying A[0]
* 1th item 20 can be accessed by specifying A[1]
On conclusion the array has the following basic properties:
1. The elements of the array should be of same datatype.
2. The data items are stored contiguosly in memory.
3. The index of the array is always an integer.

TWO DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS(MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS)
Arrays with two or more dimensions are called multi-dimensional arrays.As we know arrays with one set of square brackets [] are single 
dimensional array.Array with two sets of square brackets [][] are called MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS.For eg.

                               int b[1][1];         //b is declared as a 2-D array.
                              
 A two-dimensional array is used when data items are arranged in row-wise and column-wise in tabular fashion.To identify a particular
 item we have to specify 2 indices.
