A palindrome is a sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward.
"noon","malayalam",12321, 4554 are few examples of palindrome.
We can check if a number is a palindrome or not by taking the reverse of the number and comparing it with the original number.
To find the reverse of a number the individual digits are taken one by one from the right.Initially rev=0.At each stage rev is multiplied by 10 and added to digit,
rev found at the end the process of taking individual digits gives the reverse of the original number.
We can check if a string is a palindrome or not by taking the reverse of the string and comparing it with the original string.
To do this,the first character is compared with the last character.Then the second character is compared with last but one character and so on.
If at any stage in this process, the characters are not matched then the given string is not a palindrome.
